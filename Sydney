First as always reading the new manual.

    This is  Software Revision 02.  We have received reports  that the
    prior  version of  the  lock was  bypassable  without knowing  the
    password. We have fixed this and removed the password from memory.
    
Yes indeed it was.
After the last challenge ill be taking the manual at face value and looking to the code for guidance.
First 3 functions seem to be normal just like the last challenge.

<__do_copy_data> and <__do_clear_bss> seem to be doing the same as before.
Onwards to <main>.

4438 <main>
4438:  3150 9cff      add	#0xff9c, sp
443c:  3f40 b444      mov	#0x44b4 "Enter the password to continue.", r15
4440:  b012 6645      call	#0x4566 <puts>
4444:  0f41           mov	sp, r15
4446:  b012 8044      call	#0x4480 <get_password>
444a:  0f41           mov	sp, r15
444c:  b012 8a44      call	#0x448a <check_password>
4450:  0f93           tst	r15
4452:  0520           jnz	#0x445e <main+0x26>
4454:  3f40 d444      mov	#0x44d4 "Invalid password; try again.", r15
4458:  b012 6645      call	#0x4566 <puts>
445c:  093c           jmp	#0x4470 <main+0x38>
445e:  3f40 f144      mov	#0x44f1 "Access Granted!", r15
4462:  b012 6645      call	#0x4566 <puts>
4466:  3012 7f00      push	#0x7f
446a:  b012 0245      call	#0x4502 <INT>
446e:  2153           incd	sp
4470:  0f43           clr	r15
4472:  3150 6400      add	#0x64, sp

No <create_password> this time.
Instead its asking me to enter the password and calling the <puts> function.
Inspecting the lock manual at https://microcorruption.com/manual.pdf reveals that the <puts> function is used to print out a string to stdout, and as such I'll be ignoring any calls to <puts> from now on.
Anyways.

After entering the password there is a call to <get_password> which judging by the name just "gets" the password we entered, then we are calling <check_password> (443c) and checking if r15 is set to 0 (4450), if it is then the password is incorrect and we get an error and the execution ends.

However if r15 is set to 1 we take the jump at 4452 to 445e which grants us access by calling <INT> with the value 0x7f. Inspecting the lock manual again, reveals to us that calling interrupt with this value just opens the door.

Therefore, I will assume that r15 is set to 0 or 1 in <check_password>.

448a <check_password>
448a:  bf90 6128 0000 cmp	#0x2861, 0x0(r15)
4490:  0d20           jnz	$+0x1c
4492:  bf90 294b 0200 cmp	#0x4b29, 0x2(r15)
4498:  0920           jnz	$+0x14
449a:  bf90 5771 0400 cmp	#0x7157, 0x4(r15)
44a0:  0520           jne	#0x44ac <check_password+0x22>
44a2:  1e43           mov	#0x1, r14
44a4:  bf90 6734 0600 cmp	#0x3467, 0x6(r15)
44aa:  0124           jeq	#0x44ae <check_password+0x24>
44ac:  0e43           clr	r14
44ae:  0f4e           mov	r14, r15
44b0:  3041           ret

Interesting.
Let's go through this. (Note that since r15 is being used with offsets and compared to certain values I will just assume that it holds the password we entered, so keep that in mind.)

448a:  bf90 6128 0000 cmp	#0x2861, 0x0(r15)
4490:  0d20           jnz	$+0x1c

Here its cmp instead of cmp.b like last time, so I consulted the chip manual at https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau144j/slau144j.pdf page 56 and found this section regarding the instructions.

All single-operand and dual-operand instructions can be byte or word instructions by using .B or .W
extensions. Byte instructions are used to access byte data or byte peripherals. Word instructions are used
to access word data or word peripherals. If no extension is used, the instruction is a word instruction.

This means that we're comparing a word at a time.
That would also explain why were offsetting by 0x0, 0x2, 0x4 and 0x6.
We set r14 to 1 (44a2), and if the password is correct were setting r15 to 1 since we take the jump at 44aa to 44ae thus skipping the instruction that clears r14.
This means that we need to not take the jumps at 4490 4498 44a0 since they will also take us to 44ac and set r15 to 0.
(Note: 4490:  The $+0x1c in 
0d20           jnz	$+0x1c   
just means (current address) + 0x1c which would result in 44ac. Same applied to 4498)

Therefore, if the password is correct then it needs to pass all these compares. Meaning that the password is..

28614b2971573467
this is all in hex by the way so we need to check the hex box when were entering the password.

Spoiler. This wont work.

The issue is revealed if we consult the wikipedia page for MSP430.
"The MSP430 CPU uses a von Neumann architecture, with a single address space for instructions and data. Memory is byte-addressed, and pairs of bytes are combined little-endian to make 16-bit words."

It uses a little-endian system. This means that we need to invert the bytes of each word as follows:
instead of 2861 we need to enter 6128 and instead of 4b29 we enter 294b etc..
Resulting in
6128294b57716734

Door unlocked.
